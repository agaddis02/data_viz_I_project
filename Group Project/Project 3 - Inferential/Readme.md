### Project Requirements

##### This third project will be about getting more intermediate Tableau functionality demonstrated through dynamic dashboards

##### Using Tableau, create a dashboard (or a series of simpler dashboards) that demonstrates your facility with the material.  Your goal should be to demonstrate how the user of the dashboard could find new, non-obvious insights from the existing data.

##### Create a presentation through a recorded Teams meeting that demonstrates the use of the dashboard, whether there were any decision points you came across in the design of it, and what the utility of it is.  Include more advanced formatting options to make the data 'pop'.  Discuss, briefly, what you might see yourself doing with similar techniques in the future.

##### Finally, one representative from each group should reply to the posted presentation and critically evaluate the presentation.  Were there any major issues with the conclusions?  What things did they do well?  Were there any major issues with the presentation itself (stylistically or technically)?  What aspects of the presentation were positive?  We will forego a formal rubric this semester in favor of more freestyle feedback.

##### You will be graded on your presentation and on the presence of feedback on the other group presentations.
