### Project Requirements
##### This second project will be about getting basic Tableau functionality demonstrated through static images of descriptive statistics.

##### Using Tableau, create a set of still images (either through export or screenshots) that you will present through a recorded Teams meeting.  You're welcome to go more in depth, but at this point, the questions are just to show facility with Tableau.  Can you demonstrate basic descriptive statistics like averages, ranges, outliers?  Can you do the same for selected subgroups of data?  Formatting would be ideal, as well.

##### Finally, one representative from each group should reply to the posted presentation and critically evaluate the presentation.  Were there any major issues with the conclusions?  What things did they do well?  Were there any major issues with the presentation itself (stylistically or technically)?  What aspects of the presentation were positive?  We will forego a formal rubric this semester in favor of more freestyle feedback.

##### You will be graded on your presentation and on the presence of feedback on the other group presentations.
